# cryptozulu.

This is an app that helps to convert Steem and Steem dollars to local currency.

Users can find the current price of Steem and send its equivalent to the Steem vault.

The app generates a memo which will be used to send the naira equivalent of the Steem/SBD sent by users.

Cryptozulu will be available in other African countries soon.

It was created by John Makinde.
